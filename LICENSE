- Simple: .exe → Wolfenstein II → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, realistic FOV, no obvious animations or stats spikes  
- Kernel AC bypass — streamproof overlays, no server-side checks triggered, compatible with all DLCs (including The Diaries of Agent Silent Death & The Amazing Deeds of Captain Wilkins)  
- ESP: enemies (Nazis, robots, super soldiers, commanders, bosses), NPCs (allies, resistance members, civilians), loot crates, collectibles (gold, letters, records, concept art, weapons), hidden paths, ambushes, guard patrols, weak points on armored enemies highlighted  
- Updates post-patch/DLC (new weapons like Dieselgewehr upgrades, new perks, new difficulty modes)  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam / Bethesda Launcher)
